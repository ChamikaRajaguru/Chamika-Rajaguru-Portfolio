# Chamika Portfolio

A professional React portfolio scaffolded with Vite and plain CSS.

## Setup

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Dark theme colors and layout are defined in `src/index.css` variables and classes.
- Sections are at `#home`, `#about`, `#projects`, `#certificates`, `#contact` for smooth scrolling.
- Projects are mapped from `src/data/projects.js` and Certificates from `src/data/certificates.js`.

Style and content are starter templates; customize as needed for applications and portfolios.
